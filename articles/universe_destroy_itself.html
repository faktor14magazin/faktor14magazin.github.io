          <p>
            Could our universe end and does it indeed have to end at all? While
            the Big Bang Theory has been very well known as an explanation for
            the creation of the universe – and not only since the sitcom –
            theories about the possible decline of our universes receive less
            attention. Higgs vacuum decay proposes a possible answer to the
            opening question.
          </p>
          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>
            The universe is very old, enormously big and it is expanding at an
            accelerating rate. Initially, scientists believed that the earth was
            flat and centered the universe. Until the late 1920s, scientists did
            not realize that the Milky Way was just one of many galaxies in this
            vast universe. Shortly thereafter, astronomers realized that other
            galaxies exist and do move away from our galaxy in all directions
            and thus from our planet. Likewise, in the last decades, the idea of
            acceleration contributed to our understanding of the universe.
          </p>
          <p>
            Astrophysics initially originated in the early 19th century and has
            developed very rapidly since then. The last century especially
            revolutionized our understanding of the universe. Theories about the
            universe and its beginnings became more popular among
            astrophysicists. The Big Bang theory, first formulated by Georges
            Lemaître in 1927, provides a convincing cosmological model that
            explains how the universe began to exist. In the following decades,
            theoretical astrophysicists have not only been able to predict the
            origin of the universe but also some scenarios of its end. Since
            almost everyone agrees on the idea that the universe has an origin,
            the question emerges: "How will the universe end or does it indeed
            have an end?”
          </p>
          <h3>The Higgs Field</h3>
          <p>
            To understand how vacuum decay could destroy our universe some
            background information about the Higgs field is necessary.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the year 1964 the physicist Peter Higgs synthesized some ideas
            that were floating around at that time and added insights of his own
            in order to develop a new theory. He proposed the idea that there
            might be an energy field that permeated the entire universe, an
            energy field now called “Higgs field”. However, in the press you
            rather read about the Higgs Boson. To understand their relationship,
            you can imagine the Higgs Boson as H2O molecules and the Higgs field
            as the Ocean. When you are immersed in the Ocean, water is
            everywhere – it is a continuous medium. But at the same time, it
            consists of molecules. In an analogous sense, the Higgs Boson is the
            smallest particle of the Higgs field.
          </p>
          <p>
            Peter Higgs proposed that this energy field interacts with subatomic
            particles and thus gives these particles their mass. In this sense,
            very massive particles interact to a greater extent with the field
            while massless particles would not interact at all. To understand
            this concept better, we can use a second analogy of fish in water. A
            barracuda fish interacts only slightly with water and can move
            through it very easily, while a human can only move very slowly
            through water compared to a barracuda. Consequently, the barracuda
            fish equals a low-mass subatomic particle and the human a very
            massive subatomic particle. The lightest of the familiar subatomic
            particles is the electron while in the subatomic world the king of
            mass is the top quark. It weighs as much as an entire atom of gold –
            about three hundred and fifty thousand times more than the electron.
            However, it is stressed that the top quark is not more massive
            because it is bigger, in fact it is not. We believe that both the
            top quark and the electron are the same size! Actually, they both
            have zero sizes! The top quark is more massive than the electron
            simply because it interacts to a greater extent with the Higgs
            field. If the Higgs field would not exist, neither of these
            particles would have any mass at all!
          </p>
          <h3>The Destruction of the Universe</h3>

          <p>
            In the universe, everything tries to reach its ground state, in
            which it is completely stable and has as little energy as possible.
            For example, a ball on a hill has a lot of potential energy and thus
            is unstable. When irritated, it will roll down into the valley and
            lose its potential energy during the process. Then the ball will be
            in its ground state and stable.
          </p>
          <p>
            The key question for our universe is whether the Higgs field has
            already reached its ground state. In the context of quantum field
            theory this ground state is called true vacuum. However, it is
            possible that the Higgs field has not reached its true vacuum yet
            but is metastable. In such a scenario, this false vacuum may last
            for a limited (potentially very long) time, but eventually decays to
            the more stable state, the true vacuum. This transition process is
            known as false vacuum decay.
          </p>

          >
          <p>
            Figure 1 describes this process. As one can see, the energy level
            (E) in the false vacuum (1) is higher than in the true vacuum (3).
            However, a barrier prevents the field from classically ‘rolling
            down’ to the true vacuum. Therefore, the transition to true vacuum
            must be stimulated. There are two possible ways:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              1. The creation of high energy particles: Here the universe
              creates such a high level of energy that it can, in theory, push a
              very small part of itself into the true vacuum.
            </li>
            <li>
              2. Quantum tunneling: Quantum mechanics assumes that a particle
              can tunnel from one place into another, even in vacuum. So, the
              universe can easily tunnel through.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            No matter what triggers false vacuum decay, if only a small region
            of the universe reaches a more stable vacuum, this "bubble" (also
            called "bounce") would expand and clean out the universe.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nevertheless, Joseph Lykken, a theoretical physicist at the Fermi
            National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia, claims that if the
            transition already happened, it does not necessarily mean that the
            end of the Earth is near. It may be taking a billion years for that
            bubble to destroy the entire universe, as the distance between the
            Earth and the edge of the observable universe is 46 billion
            light-years. Moreover, if the bubble is far enough, it might never
            reach us as the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate.
